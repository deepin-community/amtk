/**
 * amtk_action_map_add_action_entries_check_dups:
 * @action_map: a #GActionMap.
 * @entries: (array length=n_entries) (element-type GActionEntry): a pointer to
 *           the first item in an array of #GActionEntry structs.
 * @n_entries: the length of @entries, or -1 if @entries is %NULL-terminated.
 * @user_data: the user data for signal connections.
 *
 * A wrapper function for g_action_map_add_action_entries() that checks
 * duplicates.
 *
 * This function first checks - for each entry - that the @action_map doesn't
 * already contain a #GAction with the same name. A warning is printed if an old
 * action will be dropped. In any case, it then calls
 * g_action_map_add_action_entries() with the same arguments as passed to this
 * function.
 *
 * This function also checks if there are duplicates in the @entries array
 * itself.
 *
 * Since: 2.0
